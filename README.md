This program is highly integrated with Google's Dialogflow and uses NOAA's ocean buoy array database to provide a surf report
in the form of a voice assistant. The VUI is deployed on Heroku and after sending an initial command (can be any message) 
should report the surf at any city or beach in the Pacific Northwest. LINK: http://johnstrenio.com/#vui
